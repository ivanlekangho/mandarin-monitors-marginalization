# Mandarin, Monitors, and Marginalization

**The Digital Machinery of Uyghur Oppression**

This repository contains a research paper analyzing how **digital platforms, state media, and language policy operate together as sociotechnical systems** to marginalize Uyghur linguistic expression in contemporary China.

The project examines how forms of linguistic oppression once enacted through education and policy are now reproduced, scaled, and circulated through **social media infrastructures and digital governance**.

## Overview

Uyghur linguistic repression in China has increasingly migrated from classrooms and local institutions into **networked digital spaces**. This paper investigates how Mandarin-centric digital systems—such as state-scripted propaganda videos, state-run news broadcasts, platform moderation practices, and app restrictions—function as tools of linguistic, cultural, and political control.

Rather than treating language policy and technology as separate domains, the analysis frames them as **interlocking mechanisms** that determine who may speak, in what language, and under what conditions.

## Research Questions

* How is social media weaponized as a tool of linguistic and cultural oppression against Uyghurs?
* How do digital platforms enforce Mandarin as the only legitimate public language?
* In what ways do Uyghur communities, particularly in the diaspora, use digital spaces to resist linguistic erasure and reclaim cultural agency?

## Case Studies

The paper analyzes four primary cases:

1. **State-scripted testimonial propaganda videos**
   Analysis of more than 3,000 coordinated videos in which Uyghurs repeat Mandarin-scripted talking points denying abuse, circulated via state platforms and international social media.

2. **“Proof-of-life” videos produced by state-run media**
   Examination of coercive interviews broadcast by CGTN and China Daily, in which Uyghurs are filmed under surveillance, speaking only in Mandarin to discipline dissent and intimidate diaspora activists.

3. **Suppression of Uyghur-language digital spaces**
   Tracing the dismantling of Uyghur-language blogs and the 2024 bans on Uyghur-language use across platforms such as WeChat and Douyin, enforced through surveillance and policing.

4. **Diaspora resistance via social media**
   A focused study of the Instagram account @TouchofTurkestan, illustrating how Uyghur diaspora communities reclaim linguistic and cultural visibility outside China’s surveillance regime.

## Frameworks

The analysis integrates three primary theoretical frameworks:

* **Linguistic imperialism** (Phillipson) to explain institutional language hierarchies
* **Linguistic capital** (Bourdieu) to analyze how Mandarin becomes a coerced currency of legitimacy
* **Linguistic economics** (Marschak; Wang) to show how language choice affects economic participation and “language poverty”

These frameworks are used to interpret digital media not as neutral tools, but as **sites where power is encoded and enforced**.

## Methods

* Literature-driven sociolinguistic analysis
* Close reading of archived propaganda and media content (via ProPublica, UHRP, and journalistic investigations)
* Comparative analysis across state media, social platforms, and diaspora spaces

This project does not present new empirical datasets; its contribution lies in **theoretical synthesis and sociotechnical interpretation**.
